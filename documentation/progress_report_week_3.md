# Week 3
- project started
- made quick versions of parts of A* and Fringe search for preliminary glance at inner workings
- doublelinkedlist and tests. for fringe.

I'm implementing A* and fringe search. Most of the time spent on fringe search, some
progress.

For the grids: game maps are the usual fare so most likely that. Ideas more than welcome.

I need grids for data and testing, a visualizer for what's happening, and tests next.
