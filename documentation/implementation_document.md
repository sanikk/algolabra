# Implementation document

## Project structure

Started with the algorithms so not much yet.
- doublelinkedlist for fringe search

## Achieved space and time complexities

With non-consistent heuristics some nodes will be expanded multiple times.

## Performance and O-analysis comparisons

Testing needed!

## Possible shortcomings and suggestions for improvement

Started late. Catching up.

## Usage of LLMs

ChatGPT is assisting me to consider possible grids faster. Elevation map of Helsinki to
avoid going up/downhill while cycling was considered, to give an example. No coding assistants, I
am still working on search logic which will need troubleshooting so it must be very human-readable.
